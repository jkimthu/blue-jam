Learned from ddPCR.Rmd: 
One gut segment without luminal material has a total segment microbial load (S) = microbes from mucus (M) + tissue (T).

Harder scraping technique increases proportion of total reads (S) from mucus (M).
This increase in M can result from either:
1. harder scraping collects more mucus and more bacteria
2. harder scraping collects some tissue-associated bugs

How to distinguish between these two scenarios?

Mucus should be more bacteria dense than tissue (REF). Increasing proportion of S than is M may be due to the possibility that we are collecting more mucus (and therefore more of the mucosal microbiome) with harder scrapings.

This latter hypothesis would be supported by:
1. the observation that the taxonomic composition of mucus vs. tissue are more distinct in harder scrapings.
2. the observation that some bugs are only present in tissue samples between gentle and harder scrapings (and not contamination)


Questions in this analysis:

1. are quantifications of distance between paired mucus and tissue communities greater in harder than gentler scraping?
   a. Bray-Curtis distance
   b. alpha diversity measurements (richness and evenness)
   
2. are specific bacteria/groups only present in tissue samples?

3. which bacteria are a larger part of the tissue community than other communities?
    - e.g. Pédron et al. 2012 find a crypt-specific core microbiota of mouse colon
           Proteobacteria are particularly abundant in crypts:
            a. Moraxellaceae (Fam); Acinetobacter (Genus): 40-50% of crypt microbiome vs. 2% in lumen
            b. Comamonadaceae (Fam); Comomonas (Genus): 2-8% of crypt microbiome
            c. Xanthomonadaceae (Fam); Stenotrophomonas (Genus): 1-30% of crypt microbiome

    - considerations: ratios vs. proportions
    - proportions can change due to changes outside of the taxon of interest, therefore going with read count RATIOS !
    - stragety: find a taxon that doesn't change in read count across samples and compare?

4. Are there taxa that consistently change in abundance (ratio) between mucus and tissue samples?
    
This analysis is performed at family level.

4. Bray-curtis doesn't yet suggest one way to go. Samples from mucus vs. tissue don't seem to cluster more closely to same location. Rather it might be that the intestinal segment and/or mouse more strongly determines distance between sample communities.
   - Next step: edit this analysis to determine whether this latter hypothesis could be true.

Pédron et al. mBio (2012): Proteobacteria are particularly abundant in crypts
    a. Moraxellaceae (Fam); Acinetobacter (Genus): 40-50% of crypt microbiome vs. 2% in lumen
    b. Comamonadaceae (Fam); Comomonas (Genus): 2-8% of crypt microbiome
    c. Xanthomonadaceae (Fam); Stenotrophomonas (Genus): 1-30% of crypt microbiome

a. Moraxellaceae are not observed here :(
b. Comamonadaceae are on there, but the different greens are hard to distinguish!
c. Xanthomonadaceae may be observed in tissue, but also hard to tell!

Next: a more targeted approach.

```{r q2.1 all unique ASVs per mouse are present in all samples from that mouse}

# q2.1: per mouse, calculate mean and st dev of ASV presence across samples

mdf <- df %>%
  filter(Mouse == 3)
  
mdf = mdf %>% 
  with_groups(OTU, mutate, MeanProp = mean(Proportion)) 

mdf = mdf %>% 
  with_groups(OTU, mutate, SDProp = sd(Proportion)) 

mdf %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=OTU, y=MeanProp, color = Family)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=MeanProp-SDProp, ymax=MeanProp+SDProp), width=.2,
                 position=position_dodge(.9)) +
  theme(legend.position = 'none')

```
This method doesn't work!! Each ASV is present as a row, even when abundance is zero!


```{r q2.3 Xanthobacteraceae & Comamonadaceae read counts}

Questions inspired from the above plot:
Are the Cyanobacteria and Verricomicrobiota real? Or contamination?
Are Bacteroidota generally more abundant in crypts/tissue than Firmicutes? Or is this noise from low read count?

Do trends between gentle or harder scraping preps change? What could lead to change?
1. Decrease suggests more mucus (or tissue) was removed and the bacteria along with it
2. Increase suggests reduction in mucus (or tissue) made remaining bugs more abundant
3. More noise suggests additional changes in direction that were not consistent with previous trend.

Example: [3,3] Erysipelotrichaeceae was increased in tissue from gentle scrapings but mixed (increase, decrease and no change) in hard scraping samples.
It is a quite abundant family, making up ~10% of ASVs in one particular tissue sample. 5-15% of ASVs in the three luminal samples.

- could looking beyond family clear up some of the noise?

Harder scrapings tend to have higher diversity in tissue than in mucus.

RE: the message from phyloseq when running this data:
"the data you have provided does not have any singletons. This is highly suspicious. Results of richness
estimates (for example) are probably unreliable, or wrong, if you have already trimmed low-abundance taxa from the data."

Outputs from DADA2 are unlikely to have singletons because single reads are often considered as error.
Especially single reads that are very similar to another more common read, DADA2 often interprets this as sequencing error.
Were we to expect some very lowly abundant organisms in some samples, we could consider a technique called "pseudopooling", which considers whether the single reads are found in different samples on the same plate. This suggests they are true sequence variants!

Overall, considering singletons only matters if we want to interpret them as reads.


```{r Bray Curtis}
# Transform data to proportions as appropriate for Bray-Curtis distances

```

```{r}
# Bray-Curtis ordination
plot_ordination(ps.prop, ord.nmds.bray, color="Location", title="Bray NMDS")
```

Luminal samples cluster together, and controls (mock, extraction and water) are grouped together away from most mouse samples.
Tissue and mucus samples are not easily distinguished however.
Which points belong to which pairs?
Does one method of scraping group in pairs and one method seem affect their likeness?






```{r confirm that "abundance" in melted ps is post-filtering reads per sample}

ps.top20 <- prune_taxa(top20, ps.top20)
plot_bar(ps.top20, x="Mouse", fill="Family") + facet_wrap(~Location, scales="free_x")
```

Plotting the top 20 families only gets us <75% of reads in some samples, <25% of reads than in others. Try plotting more families, say 40. See below!


```{r}
# Bar plot, top 40 most abundant families
top40 <- names(sort(taxa_sums(ps), decreasing=TRUE))[1:40]
ps.top40 <- transform_sample_counts(ps, function(OTU) OTU/sum(OTU))
ps.top40 <- prune_taxa(top40, ps.top40)
plot_bar(ps.top40, x="Mouse", fill="Family") + facet_wrap(~Location, scales="free_x")
```
Hm, after including most abundant 40 families, now we see abundances of over 1... 
Something is not right. What are we actually plotting?
