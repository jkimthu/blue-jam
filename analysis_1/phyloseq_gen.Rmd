Questions in this analysis:

1. Are there taxa that consistently change in abundance (ratio) between mucus and tissue samples?
    
This analysis is performed at genus level.

Questions inspired from the above plot:
Are the Cyanobacteria and Verricomicrobiota real? Or contamination?
Are Bacteroidota generally more abundant in crypts/tissue than Firmicutes? Or is this noise from low read count?

Do trends between gentle or harder scraping preps change? What could lead to change?
1. Decrease suggests more mucus (or tissue) was removed and the bacteria along with it
2. Increase suggests reduction in mucus (or tissue) made remaining bugs more abundant
3. More noise suggests additional changes in direction that were not consistent with previous trend.

Example: [3,3] Erysipelotrichaeceae was increased in tissue from gentle scrapings but mixed (increase, decrease and no change) in hard scraping samples.
It is a quite abundant family, making up ~10% of ASVs in one particular tissue sample. 5-15% of ASVs in the three luminal samples.

- could looking beyond family clear up some of the noise?

```{r alpha diversity}

Harder scrapings tend to have higher diversity in tissue than in mucus.

RE: the message from phyloseq when running this data:
"the data you have provided does not have any singletons. This is highly suspicious. Results of richness
estimates (for example) are probably unreliable, or wrong, if you have already trimmed low-abundance taxa from the data."

Outputs from DADA2 are unlikely to have singletons because single reads are often considered as error.
Especially single reads that are very similar to another more common read, DADA2 often interprets this as sequencing error.
Were we to expect some very lowly abundant organisms in some samples, we could consider a technique called "pseudopooling", which considers whether the single reads are found in different samples on the same plate. This suggests they are true sequence variants!

Overall, considering singletons only matters if we want to interpret them as reads.


```{r Bray Curtis}
# Transform data to proportions as appropriate for Bray-Curtis distances
ps.prop <- transform_sample_counts(ps, function(otu) otu/sum(otu))
ord.nmds.bray <- ordinate(ps.prop, method="NMDS", distance="bray")
```

```{r}
# Bray-Curtis ordination
plot_ordination(ps.prop, ord.nmds.bray, color="Location", title="Bray NMDS")
```

Luminal samples cluster together, and controls (mock, extraction and water) are grouped together away from most mouse samples.
Tissue and mucus samples are not easily distinguished however.
Which points belong to which pairs?
Does one method of scraping group in pairs and one method seem affect their likeness?






```{r confirm that "abundance" in melted ps is post-filtering reads per sample}
ps.m1 = subset_samples(ps, Mouse == "1")
mouse1 = psmelt(ps.m1)
colnames(mouse1)
m1 = ggplot(mouse1, aes(x=Location, y=Abundance, fill=Phylum))
m1 = m1 + geom_bar(color="black", stat="identity", position="stack") #+ facet_wrap(~Mouse)
print(m1)
```

```{r analysis1}
# transform abundance from read counts to rel abundundance per sample
ps.m1.rel <- transform_sample_counts(ps.m1, function(OTU) OTU/sum(OTU)) 
mouse1.rel = psmelt(ps.m1.rel)
colnames(mouse1.rel)
m1r = ggplot(mouse1.rel, aes(x=Location, y=Abundance, fill=Phylum))
m1r = m1r + geom_bar(color="black", stat="identity", position="stack") #+ facet_wrap(~Mouse)
print(m1r)
```

```{r}
# Bar plot, top 20 most abundant families
top20 <- names(sort(taxa_sums(ps), decreasing=TRUE))[1:20]
ps.top20 <- transform_sample_counts(ps, function(OTU) OTU/sum(OTU))
ps.top20 <- prune_taxa(top20, ps.top20)
plot_bar(ps.top20, x="Mouse", fill="Family") + facet_wrap(~Location, scales="free_x")
```

Plotting the top 20 families only gets us <75% of reads in some samples, <25% of reads than in others. Try plotting more families, say 40. See below!


```{r}
# Bar plot, top 40 most abundant families
top40 <- names(sort(taxa_sums(ps), decreasing=TRUE))[1:40]
ps.top40 <- transform_sample_counts(ps, function(OTU) OTU/sum(OTU))
ps.top40 <- prune_taxa(top40, ps.top40)
plot_bar(ps.top40, x="Mouse", fill="Family") + facet_wrap(~Location, scales="free_x")
```
Hm, after including most abundant 40 families, now we see abundances of over 1... 
Something is not right. What are we actually plotting?
